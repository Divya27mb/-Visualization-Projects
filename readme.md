# Visualization Projects
## Project-1
- I make an interactive visualization which can be used to compare two soccer teams of most watched soccer league English Premier League.
- I used Bokeh library to make this whole project and some libraries like pandas for data processing.
- Data contains last 10 years all teams performance every year with stats like wins, loss, rank, penalties etc. There are more than 20 attributes which I further bifurcate in defense, attack , midfield and stats.
- User can choose any two teams from last 10 years and also they can choose which season's  data  they want to include.

## Project-2
- It has two dashboard one having radar chart for comparing any two soccer player from the datasets and other one is geo-visualization, where you can see in world from where which kind of player mostly produce.
- Dataset is very huge with having data like player's nationality, age, favorite foot, position, club etc. It needed lots of cleaning and data preprocessing.
- I had lots of interactive filter which helps to find which country has which kind of players. It says lot of every country's football culture.
